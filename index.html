<p>Hi, this is the wepbage of Nicholas Farrell. I am currently a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis (UMSL). I am an IS major and have taken a few courses in wepdesign and programing already but am hoping to expand my knowledge and hopefully be able to find a job.</p>

<p>&#9774 Peace!</p>
